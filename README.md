Final Year Project named Quotr. A cross platform mobile application which identifies TV shows and movies using quotes from the show or movie. The application records a snippet of audio which is sent to the server where it is searched to find a matching TV show or movie. If a result is found, data from the TV show or movie is sent back to the application where it is displayed for the user.

The Quotr folder contains the code used to create the Quotr application for both Andriod and iOS which was developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and AngularJS using Apache Cordova. 
The ServerAPP folder holds the code which is on the server and is used to run the API. This is written in Python and uses Python Flask.
Initial proposal, interim and final reports can also be viewed which show the process in creating the application.
